    <p><h2><strong>What is Art?</strong></h2></p>
        <p><h3>For as long as humanity has existed, art has been part of our lives. For many years, people have been creating and enjoying art.  It expresses emotions or expression of life. It is one such creation that enables interpretation of any kind.
        
        It is a skill that applies to music, painting, poetry, dance and more. Moreover, nature is no less than art. For instance, if nature creates something unique, it is also art. Artists use their artwork for passing along their feelings.
        
        Thus, art and artists bring value to society and have been doing so throughout history. Art gives us an innovative way to view the world or society around us. Most important thing is that it lets us interpret it on our own individual experiences and associations.
        
        Art is similar to live which has many definitions and examples. What is constant is that art is not perfect or does not revolve around perfection. It is something that continues growing and developing to express emotions, thoughts and human capacities.</h3></p>

        <p><h2><strong>IMPORTANCE OF ART</strong></h2></p>
        <p><h3>”Art is your emotions flowing in a river of imagination”. If you stand for a moment in front any work of art, which has many shapes and many line cannot be described, you start to imagine things by walking on that lines and shapes trying to connect them to get a specific shape done from your imagination. What if the picture is a sunrise? You will begin thinking in every sadness or happiness things that happened to you. No one these days knows the really importance of art. Art is everywhere in the entire world. It is one’s creativity and imagination. Art is the most things you use and see always without paying attention to that. If you want to know what does art mean? You have to look at every thing surrounding you, at every thing you use in your daily life, you will notice that every thing you see shows an art, especially your clothes, your hair design, your shoes etc… All of them are arts. Art help us see everything and everyone completely different. Art is not a reading to get bored or listening to get epileptic, it’s something which opens to us a field of questions and answers to things we see. That’s up to us. It doesn’t impose itself on us to hear, think, or even understand; on the contrary it takes us to a long-lost world, to a fiction world, to a field of thoughts. Art can be in different forms audio like music, songs, and poems. Visual as film making, photography and painting, they differ depending on artist, style and material used</h3></p>
